lightning network poker draft.



# About me:

First of all I must say that I am not a professional programmer and English is not my native language. I do this to learn and as a hobby and as a way to contribute to the community.

I am also a poker player, a very bad one.


# introduction:

After a long time as a poker player and passionate about the possibilities offered by the blockchain technology, I have identified certain characteristics that traditional gaming platforms do not satisfy in my opinion

# Goals:

Provide a place for discussion and exchange of ideas, unify the effort to try to develop software that meets the characteristics that do not meet traditional gaming platforms.


# Contributions:

Any contribution is well received, I will try to make this space as open as possible.
